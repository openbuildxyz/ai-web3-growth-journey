# Gen3Dao: The AI-Powered DAO Creator

Gen3Dao is a next-generation, web-based tool that empowers users to visually design, generate, and register Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) with the help of an advanced AI assistant. This entire application, from its user interface to its core logic, was developed in collaboration with an AI code generation tool, showcasing a new paradigm in software development.

## Core Concept

Building a DAO requires significant expertise in smart contract development and governance design. Gen3Dao abstracts away this complexity by providing an intuitive, visual canvas where users can construct their DAO's architecture by simply dragging and dropping components or by describing their needs to an AI. The visual design is then used by a powerful AI model to generate complete, production-ready Solidity smart contracts.

## Key Features

### 1. AI Assistant (Powered by Google Gemini)
The cornerstone of Gen3Dao is its integrated AI assistant. Users can interact with it using natural language to:
- **Build DAO Structures**: "Create a grants DAO with a token, voting, and a treasury."
- **Add and Connect Components**: The AI understands the logical relationships between components and automatically connects them on the canvas.
- **Generate Custom Modules**: "Add a module to distribute 20% of profits to token holders quarterly." The AI will create a custom node with this logic described.

### 2. Visual Drag-and-Drop Canvas
The interface features a dynamic canvas (built with React Flow) where DAO components are represented as nodes. Users can:
- Manually drag components like `Token`, `Voting`, or `Treasury` from a palette.
- Rearrange nodes and draw connections (edges) between them.
- See a real-time visual representation of their DAO's governance flow.

### 3. Real-time Configuration
Selecting any node on the canvas opens a configuration panel. Here, users can fine-tune critical parameters without writing any code:
- **Token**: Set the name, symbol, and initial supply.
- **Voting**: Define the voting period and proposal threshold.
- **Quorum**: Set the minimum participation percentage for a vote to be valid.
- **Timelock**: Specify the delay before a passed proposal can be executed.

### 4. AI Smart Contract Generation
This is where the magic happens. With a single click, the user's visual design and configurations are sent to a specialized AI model (Google Gemini) that has been trained to:
- Interpret the nodes and edges as a governance architecture.
- Write complete, secure, and deployable Solidity smart contracts.
- Replace all placeholder logic with fully implemented functions for proposals, voting, execution, and treasury management.

```solidity
// Example of AI-generated Governor contract logic
function propose(
    address[] memory targets,
    uint256[] memory values,
    bytes[] memory calldatas,
    string memory description
) public returns (uint256) {
    // ... AI implements proposal creation, checks, and state updates
}

function castVote(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support) public {
    // ... AI implements vote casting, snapshotting, and vote counting
}
```

### 5. On-Chain Registration & Dashboard
After generation, users can:
- **Preview Contracts**: Review the generated Solidity code in a clean, tabbed interface.
- **Register the DAO**: After deploying the contracts manually (using tools like Remix or Hardhat), users register their main Governor contract address. This links their on-chain DAO to their Gen3Dao dashboard.
- **View DAOs**: A dedicated dashboard lists all the DAOs a user has registered, fetching their details from the blockchain and IPFS.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Visual Canvas**: React Flow
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (for both the chat assistant and contract generation)
- **Web3**: Wagmi for wallet connectivity, Viem
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS (via Pinata) for storing DAO metadata
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity

## Future Scope

Gen3Dao is a foundational platform with enormous potential. The roadmap includes:

- **One-Click Deployment**: Integrate contract compilation and deployment directly within the application, removing the need for external tools. Users will be able to go from design to a live, on-chain DAO in a single, seamless flow.
- **Full DAO Management Suite**: Expand the dashboard into a comprehensive management interface where users can create proposals, vote on them, and monitor treasury activity directly.
- **AI-Powered Security Audits**: Leverage AI to perform preliminary security checks on the generated smart contracts, flagging potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **Advanced Custom Logic**: Enhance the AI's ability to generate complex, novel smart contract modules based on user descriptions, opening the door for highly specialized DAOs.
- **Multi-Chain Deployments**: Add support for deploying to a wide range of EVM-compatible chains (e.g., Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism) directly from the interface.

## A Note on AI-Powered Development

This project stands as a testament to the power of AI as a co-pilot in software engineering. The entire application, including its component structure, state management, and backend logic, was built iteratively with an AI assistant. This approach dramatically accelerated development time and enabled the implementation of complex features with greater efficiency.
