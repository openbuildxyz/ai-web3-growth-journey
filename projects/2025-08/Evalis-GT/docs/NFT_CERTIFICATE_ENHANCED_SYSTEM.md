## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. Enhanced Rewards Controller (`rewardsController.js`)
```javascript
// Automatic certificate awarding for Silver+ grades
const awardBadgeBasedRewards = async (req, res) => {
  // ... existing badge logic ...
  
  // Auto-award certificate for scores >= 80%
  if (score >= 80) {
    const certificateResult = await mintCertificate(
      student.walletAddress,
      certificateMetadata
    );
    results.certificate = certificateResult;
  }
};

// Manual certificate awarding endpoint
const awardManualCertificate = async (req, res) => {
  const { submissionId } = req.params;
  const { reason } = req.body;
  
  // Generate metadata and mint certificate
  const metadata = await generateCertificateMetadata(submission, reason);
  const result = await mintCertificate(student.walletAddress, metadata);
  
  return res.json({ success: true, txHash: result.hash });
};
```

#### 2. New API Routes (`web3Routes.js`)
```javascript
// Manual certificate awarding endpoint
router.post('/award/certificate/manual/:submissionId', 
  requireAuth, 
  rewardsController.awardManualCertificate
);
```

#### 3. Enhanced Teacher Service (`teacherService.ts`)
```typescript
export const awardManualCertificate = async (
  submissionId: number, 
  reason: string
): Promise<any> => {
  const response = await apiClient.post(
    `/web3/award/certificate/manual/${submissionId}`,
    { reason }
  );
  return response.data;
};
```

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Enhanced Teacher Portal (`TeacherPortal.tsx`)

**Automatic Status Indicator:**
```tsx
{submission.score >= 80 ? (
  <Badge className="bg-green-100 text-green-800 border-green-200">
    Auto-Awarded ‚úì
  </Badge>
) : (
  <Button onClick={() => handleAwardManualCertificate(...)}>
    <Award className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
    Award Certificate
  </Button>
)}
```

**Enhanced Grade Submit Button:**
```tsx
<Button onClick={() => handleGradeSubmission(submission.id)}>
  Submit Grade
  {gradingScores[submission.id] >= 80 && (
    <span className="bg-green-400 text-green-900 px-2 py-1 rounded">
      + Badge + NFT
    </span>
  )}
</Button>
```
