# Evalis-GT Production Server Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Database Connection Problems**
**Problem**: The serverless function was failing to connect to AWS RDS PostgreSQL database, causing 500 errors.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added connection timeouts (15s for Vercel, 30s for others)
- Enhanced error logging for better debugging
- Added database connectivity checks in health endpoint
- Improved connection pooling for serverless environment
- Added retry logic and better error handling

### 2. **API Endpoint Improvements**
**Problem**: API endpoints were returning generic 500 errors without useful debugging information.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced error responses with timestamps and detailed error messages
- Added comprehensive logging for teacher portal endpoints
- Improved auth/status endpoint with database connectivity check
- Fixed teacher subjects, batches, and students endpoints
- Added proper model initialization checks

### 3. **Teacher Portal Specific Issues**
**Problem**: Teacher portal couldn't load students, batches, or subjects.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed `/api/teachers/subjects` endpoint with proper authentication
- Enhanced `/api/teachers/batches` to fetch batches from subject associations
- Improved `/api/teachers/:id/students` to get students from accessible batches
- Added proper relationship handling between subjects, batches, and semesters

### 4. **Environment Configuration**
**Problem**: Environment variables might not be properly configured in Vercel.

**Solution Created**:
- Created `setup-vercel-env.sh` script to set all required environment variables
- Enhanced health check to verify environment configuration

## Files Modified

1. **`server/serverless-robust.js`**
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Improved database connection with timeouts
   - Fixed teacher portal endpoints
   - Enhanced health check endpoint

2. **`server/config/db.js`**
   - Added connection timeouts for serverless environment
   - Enhanced error logging and diagnostics
   - Improved connection retry logic

3. **`setup-vercel-env.sh`** (NEW)
   - Script to configure all Vercel environment variables
   - Includes all Firebase, database, and JWT configurations

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables
Run the environment setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup-vercel-env.sh
./setup-vercel-env.sh
```

Or manually set these critical variables in Vercel dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret
- `NODE_ENV`: "production"
- All Firebase configuration variables

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Test the Deployment
1. Check health endpoint: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health`
2. Test teacher login and portal functionality
3. Verify batch/student loading in teacher portal

## Debugging Information

### Health Check Endpoint
The enhanced health endpoint (`/api/health`) now provides:
- Database connectivity status
- Environment variable verification
- Connection diagnostics
- Deployment information

### Error Logging
All endpoints now include:
- Detailed error messages
- Timestamps
- Stack traces (in development)
- Request context information

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Database Connection Timeout**
   - Check AWS RDS security group allows connections from 0.0.0.0/0
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correctly set in Vercel
   - Ensure RDS instance is running and publicly accessible

2. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify JWT_SECRET is set in environment
   - Check token format and expiration
   - Ensure user roles are correctly assigned

3. **Teacher Portal Empty Data**
   - Verify teacher has subjects assigned in database
   - Check subject-batch relationships
   - Ensure TeacherSubject join table has correct entries

## Database Relationships

For teacher portal to work correctly, ensure these relationships exist:
```
Teacher → TeacherSubject → Subject → Batch → Student
                    ↓
                 Semester → Student (activeSemesterId)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Check Vercel function logs
   - Monitor database connection metrics
   - Test all teacher portal features

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider implementing connection pooling
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Monitor serverless function cold starts

3. **Additional Improvements**
   - Add rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Implement comprehensive error reporting
   - Add monitoring and alerting

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check `/api/health` endpoint for diagnostics
2. Review Vercel function logs
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test database connectivity from external tools

The fixes applied should resolve the 500 server errors and restore full functionality to the teacher portal.
