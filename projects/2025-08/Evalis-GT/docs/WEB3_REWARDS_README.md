## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
cd web3
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Web3 Configuration
CHAIN_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
MINTER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
TOKEN_ADDRESS=deployed_token_address
CERTIFICATE_ADDRESS=deployed_certificate_address
GOVERNOR_ADDRESS=deployed_governor_address
```

### 3. Update Database

The Certificate model is already included. Ensure migrations are run:
```bash
npm run migrate
```

### 4. Start the Application

```bash

## üîß API Reference

### Award EVT Tokens

```http
POST /api/web3/award/tokens
Authorization: Bearer <teacher_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "studentId": "S12345",
  "amount": 50,
  "reason": "Excellent assignment submission"
}
```

### Award NFT Certificate

```http
POST /api/web3/award/certificate
Authorization: Bearer <teacher_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "submissionId": 123,
  "metadataUri": "" // Optional - auto-generated if empty
}
```

### Get Student Balance

```http
GET /api/web3/student/S12345/balance
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only teachers and admins can award tokens/certificates
- Students can only view their own rewards
- Wallet linking requires authentication

### Blockchain Security
- Private keys stored securely in environment variables
- Minting restricted to authorized addresses
- Transaction verification and error handling

### Data Validation
- Input validation for all reward parameters
- Duplicate award prevention
- Wallet address format validation

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
./test-web3-implementation.sh
```

### Test Scenarios

1. **Teacher awards tokens during grading**
2. **Student views rewards in portal**
3. **NFT certificate minting for high scores**
4. **Wallet connection and balance display**
5. **Batch token awarding**

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Multi-chain support (Polygon, BSC)
- Token staking for additional benefits
- Marketplace for trading certificates
- Advanced governance features

### Integration Opportunities
