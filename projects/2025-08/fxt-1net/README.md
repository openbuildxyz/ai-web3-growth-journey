# AI Smart Contract Generator

> Generate, audit, and deploy smart contracts from plain English using AI + MetaMask.  

---

## Problem
Smart contracts are the backbone of Web3, but writing them requires deep Solidity knowledge.  
This keeps **90% of creators and entrepreneurs locked out of Web3 innovation**.

---

## Solution
**AI Smart Contract Generator** allows anyone to describe their idea in natural language and instantly get a **secure, deployable contract**.

-  **Plain English â†’ Solidity** (AI-powered)
-  **Compile** with solc to ABI + Bytecode
-  **Deploy** via MetaMask & ethers.js
-  **Security Analyzer** (warns about risky code patterns)
-  **Gas Estimation** before deployment
-  **Instant Interaction** with deployed contracts (call functions directly) (planned for future)

## How It Works - Example flow
1. **Enter Prompt**  
   `"ERC20 token named HackathonCoin with 1B supply"`
2. **AI Generation**  
   OpenAI generates Solidity contract code.
3. **Compile**  
   Our API compiles the code â†’ returns ABI & bytecode.
4. **Deploy**  
   Connect MetaMask & deploy directly on testnet.
5. **Interact**  
   Call contract functions from our frontend.
