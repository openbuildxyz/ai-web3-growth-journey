AI Prompts Used in This Project
This document contains a selection of the key prompts given to an AI assistant to generate the core components of the AI NFT Marketplace. Each prompt is followed by a brief summary of the AI's response.

1. Prompt for the NFT Smart Contract
My Prompt:

"Create a Solidity smart contract for an NFT named AI_NFT. It should be an ERC721 token that inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC721URIStorage for metadata. Include a mint function that can only be called by the contract owner to create a new token and assign it a tokenURI. Emit a Minted event with the owner, tokenId, and tokenURI."

AI's Response:
The AI generated a complete AI_NFT.sol contract that correctly implemented the ERC721 standard using OpenZeppelin. It provided a secure mint function protected by the onlyOwner modifier as requested. The contract correctly managed token IDs and emitted a Minted event with the specified parameters, making it ready for deployment.

2. Prompt for the Node.js Backend with IPFS
My Prompt:

"Write a Node.js Express server with a single POST endpoint at /api/generate. This endpoint should take a prompt from the request body, call the Hugging Face API to generate an image, and then upload that image to IPFS using Pinata. Finally, it should create and upload a metadata JSON file to IPFS and return the final tokenURI to the client."

AI's Response:
The AI delivered a full server.js file with the specified /api/generate endpoint. The code correctly handled the multi-step async workflow: calling the Hugging Face API, creating a buffer from the image response, and then using axios and form-data to upload the image and subsequent metadata to Pinata's IPFS service. The final response correctly sent back the tokenURI.

3. Prompt for the Vanilla JS Frontend
My Prompt:

"Generate a single index.html file for the NFT marketplace frontend. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript. The UI should have a button to connect MetaMask, a text area for a prompt, and a button to generate an image. The script should call the backend, display the preview image, and then handle the minting and listing transactions using Ethers.js."

AI's Response:
The AI created a self-contained index.html file with a clean, responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS classes. The embedded JavaScript successfully managed the application's state, including connecting to MetaMask and fetching the user's account. It correctly handled the fetch call to the backend and used Ethers.js to instantiate the contracts and call the mint and listItem functions, including the logic to parse the tokenId from the transaction receipt.

4. Prompt for the Project README.md
My Prompt:

"Create a professional README.md file for this project. Include sections for Core Features, Technology Stack, Architecture, and a detailed Getting Started guide with installation and running instructions. The tone should be clear and helpful for another developer."

AI's Response:
The AI generated a well-structured and comprehensive README.md file using Markdown formatting. It included all the requested sections, accurately describing the project's features and the technology stack in a table. The "Getting Started" guide provided clear, step-by-step instructions that were easy for a new developer to follow.
