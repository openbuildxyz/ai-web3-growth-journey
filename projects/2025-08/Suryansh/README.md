## 🚀 Project Overview
AI ContractForge is an AI-powered smart contract generator that enables users to design, deploy, and interact with blockchain contracts seamlessly.  
Our vision was to **democratize blockchain development** by making contract creation as easy as chatting with an AI.  

This project was built during the **AI x Web3 Hackathon**.
