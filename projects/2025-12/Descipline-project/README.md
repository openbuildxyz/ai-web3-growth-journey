After each lesson there is an assignment, which will consist of questions about the material and answers will be evaluated by AI. To ensure continuous learning a community module based on DAO is introduced, there should be a pool each day in which real money is stored. The pool is distributed based on assignment resutls.

* community module based on DAO (rewards/penalties)
* learning module improve trading skills

Demo: for demo purposes the pool will be collected once and distributed once after completing demo lesson.
