Project Info

From Siamese tabbies caught mid-yawn to kittens quantum-leaping into cardboard boxes, the internet runs on cat content. But we believe those views should have value.
Stop scrolling for free and start doomscrolling for a cause.
Now imagine every time someone hits ‘like', a whisper-thin donation slips into the creator's paw. Not dollars but pennies, all using blockchain technology. These small donations are enough to buy kibble without denting your matcha fund.

That's OnlyPaws: OnlyFans for cats, where fandom meets feline charity, one purr at a time.
We're not just another doom scrolling platform. While every scroll floods your dopamine, ours floods shelters. Every micro-donation funnels upstream—ten percent auto-tipped to local rescues, no middle-cat.

What's in it for the Creators? They keep 80% of all the money donated, cashing out for helping out cats in need or anything else!

All powered by a quiet, lightning-fast layer-two (Base). Scroll, like and donate or post, earn and inspire.

Whether you're the hooman filming chaotic zoomies or the viewer hooked on midnight whiskers, OnlyPaws stitches the loop: creators thrive, shelters stockpile blankets, treats, medical supplies and the internet's obsession with cats turns into real whiskers-on-the-ground.
