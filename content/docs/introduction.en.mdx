## What is AI¬≥ Growth Journey

"AI is eating software, Web3 is restructuring production relationships." While Vitalik and Sam Altman have yet to shake hands at Davos, code and smart contracts are already reshaping the world's operating rules. At this moment, a developer awakening movement spanning the Asia-Pacific is about to embark!

AI¬≥ Growth Journey is an AI+Web3 series of activities jointly launched by OpenBuild and Weekly Hackathon. Starting from March, over the next 10 months, we will conduct online collaborative learning each month based on specific themes/ecosystems in the AI + Web3 field, and randomly select hotspot cities to hold offline Mini-Hackathons, guiding developers to produce project applications related to specific themes/ecosystems.

## Why is the Fusion of AI and Web3 So Important?

The convergence of AI and Web3 is creating entirely new possibilities:

- **Lowering Technical Barriers**: AI tools make writing complex smart contracts simpler
- **Optimizing Development Efficiency**: Automating code generation, testing, and auditing processes
- **Expanding Application Scenarios**: Enabling autonomous agents, on-chain data analysis, personalized experiences
- **Empowering DAO Governance**: Improving collaboration efficiency and collective decision-making quality

This fusion provides entry opportunities for participants of all technical levels, whether you're an experienced blockchain developer or a newcomer just starting to explore.

## Two Target Audiences

Our content is carefully designed for two types of developers:

### üí° Developers Unfamiliar with Web3

If you're an AI engineer, Web2 developer, or curious about the blockchain world, we'll help you:
- Understand the fundamentals of blockchain and smart contracts
- Quickly master Web3 technologies like Solidity using AI tools
- Build your first decentralized application

You will learn:
- **Understanding Web3 Fundamentals**: Core principles of blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications
- **Mastering Basic Tools**: How to use wallets and interact with blockchain
- **Applying AI Programming Assistants**: Using AI tools (like Cursor, Copilot) to quickly learn and write smart contracts
- **Building Simple Applications**: Constructing your first Web3 application from scratch

### üíé Web3 Developers Seeking AI Empowerment

If you're already familiar with blockchain development but want to leverage AI to improve efficiency, we'll help you:
- Integrate AI code assistants into smart contract development workflows
- Optimize complex contract design and auditing processes
- Explore innovative application scenarios for AI+Web3

You will learn:
- **Advanced AI Code Assistant Applications**: Integrating AI tools into smart contract development workflows
- **Optimizing Development Efficiency**: Using AI to accelerate testing, auditing, and deployment processes
- **Breaking Through Technical Bottlenecks**: Solving complex contract design and optimization problems
- **Exploring Cutting-edge Applications**: Building innovative projects that fuse AI+Web3

## Annual Activity Planning

In this program, we will explore different AI+Web3 themes each month:

- **Write Smart Contract with AI Code Assistant** - Using AI code assistants (like Cursor, Copilot) to write smart contracts
- **How to write a professional AI Prompt** - Professional AI prompt engineering
- **Build with Web3 AI Agent** - Building Web3 AI agents (ai16z, virtuals, etc.)
- **OnChain Data Insight with AI** - Using AI to analyze on-chain data
- **No code Dapps** - No-code decentralized application development
- **AI Gaming / AIGC in Web3** - AI gaming and AIGC in Web3

Each theme includes online workshops and offline Mini-Hackathons to help you comprehensively master skills from theory to practice.

## Benefits of Participating in Activities

By participating in AI¬≥ Growth Journey, you will:

- üî• Unlock a disruptive proposition every month: From AI Agents to on-chain smart contracts, from AIGC games to no-code DApps, each tech stack is a ticket to a new world
- üî• Participate in offline activities in major Asia-Pacific cities: Prove the sharpest code with 12-hour rapid development
- üî• Co-build with 15,000+ developers: Your project will traverse a network of 200,000 developers, reaching the radar of top incubators and investors
- üéÅ Receive limited edition "Cyber Merit" NFT badges, exclusive merchandise, and opportunities for late-night ramen sessions with top VCs

## March Theme: Writing Smart Contracts with AI Code Assistants

This month we will focus on exploring how to write, test, and optimize smart contracts with the help of AI tools (like Cursor, Copilot). Whether you're a Web3 newcomer or an experienced developer, you can benefit from the following content:

### Learning Path

1. **Basic Introduction** (For Web3 newcomers)
   - Understanding basic smart contract concepts
   - Setting up development environment and AI assistants
   - Using AI to write your first simple contract

2. **Advanced Practice** (For experienced developers)
   - Using AI to optimize contract performance and security
   - Prompt engineering techniques for handling complex business logic
   - Combining AI for contract testing and auditing

3. **Practical Projects**
   - Full-process practice from requirement analysis to deployment
   - Application development based on current hot ecosystems
   - Preparation for participating in Shenzhen Mini-Hackathon

## Choose the Learning Path That Suits You

Based on your technical background and learning needs, we provide different entry guides:

| Study Camp | Target Audience | Content Features |
